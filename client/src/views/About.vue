I have always had two loves in my life, food and fitness. As a kid I played every sport I could possibly play. From going to soccer games to wrestling matches, my family seemed to always be on the go. I noticed one thing that seemed to stop the world around us, dinner. We would stop our busy days to come around the table for a good meal. This connection with dinner and family is why I fell in love with food.
Starting in the restaurant industry at a young age gave me a lot of experience with different cuisine. From learning in the restaurant to cooking for myself at home I was around food a lot. When I wasn’t cooking, I was playing sports or working out. My two lives always seemed so separate and seemed like two different worlds. As my career grew and so did my passion for working out, I started to cook healthier meals for myself and sometimes cooking for clients to help them gain or lose weight. It became difficult to meal prep with a busy schedule, I would then try other meal prep companies and it seemed all they cared about was the calories or the macro nutrients. The convenience was great, but I wasn’t sold on the products.
For being in the restaurant business for around 15 years and doing CrossFit for about 3 years I have been wanting to merge the two careers. This is when the creation of Fresh Platez Kitchen came into play. People who want to eat healthy due to wanting to push further in their fitness life or people who just care in what they put in their body is what Fresh Platez is for. There are so many different meal prep companies out there from some created by chefs with great food, but no real nutrition or nutritionist just focusing of the nutrition but not the taste. Fresh Platez takes both, nutrition and flavor, into every bite. I want to make sure people are getting quality meals they could get at a restaurant, but they can eat and feel great after.
